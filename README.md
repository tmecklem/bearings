# Bearings

Bearings is a personal goal tracker for setting daily goals, communicating those goals, and allowing an accountability partner or other interested party have access to give support.

Key features needed:
- [ ] Daily planning/log with public and private content areas supporting markdown
- [ ] Daily goal list that rolls over into next day's planning to track completion of previous day
- [ ] Quarterly or yearly milestone planning to link daily goals toward

## Bearings runs on a Phoenix server and is built with Elixir

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
